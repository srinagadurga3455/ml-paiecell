Why NumPy is Used in Machine Learning????

>NumPy is a core library in Machine Learning because it provides efficient numerical computation using multi-dimensional arrays.
Most ML libraries (Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow) are built on top of NumPy.

>NumPy is preferred because:

>It is faster than Python lists for numerical operations

>It supports vectorized computations

>It handles large datasets efficiently


NumPy Arrays vs Python Lists

>>>>>Python Lists

>Can store mixed data types

>Slower for numerical computation

>No direct support for mathematical operations

>>>>>NumPy Arrays

>Store elements of the same data type

>Optimized for numerical calculations

>Support element-wise mathematical operations


>>>>>Array Creation, Shape, and Indexing

>NumPy allows creation of arrays from lists or directly using built-in functions.

Key concepts:

>Array: A collection of elements of the same data type

>Shape: Describes the dimensions of an array (rows, columns)

>Indexing: Used to access specific elements, rows, or columns


>>>>>Basic Mathematical Operations

>NumPy supports fast mathematical operations on arrays, such as:

>Mean (average value)

>Minimum value

>Maximum value

>Element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

>These operations are applied directly to arrays without using loops.
